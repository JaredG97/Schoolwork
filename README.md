How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories are helpful tools for gathering product requirements directly from the people who will be using them. Process the English they're speaking into a notepad and translate that into readable tech jargon. Distribute to those who need to know.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Breaking down a project into its base requirements and working in sprints with my team members.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Communicate effectively and take complete responsibility of your actions.
