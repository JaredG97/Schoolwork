How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories are helpful tools for gathering product requirements directly from the people who will be using them. Process the English they're speaking into a notepad and translate that into readable tech jargon. Distribute to those who need to know.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Breaking down a project into its base requirements and working in sprints with my team members.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Communicate effectively and take complete responsibility of your actions.

**Operating Platforms**
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room seeks to develop a multiplatform game titled “Draw it or Lose it”, a team-based puzzle game designed in reference to the 1980s television show “Win, Lose, or Draw”. They currently do not understand how to set up the environment for the game. We are going to propose a web-hosted solution and design it.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
If I'm being honest, nothing spectactular other than developing it very quickly due to time constraints. If I had to pick, I drew upon my professional experience a lot to flesh it out. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The rubber duck theory helped me immensely. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Going back and redoing the code for Project 1. I would have taken the time to talk myself through it more.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
They're paying you for a product, whether you like what they want or not. Propose realism, find a middle ground if something is impossible.
At the end of the day we're more than code monkeys, we're people. We have to interface on a personal level and make it sound like english for them so they get what they want.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I utilized my previous course knowledge of the SDLC, my professional knowlegde, and what I've picked up over the years collaborating on personal projects. 
Ask for help is something I should be doing a lot more of moving forward. I plan on holding myself to that.
